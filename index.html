<p>Welcome humble mindfuck, welcome to one of the many sites that would probably turn into nothing, unless it does.</p>

<p>This site is an intended space for a group of friends mainly, which are considered but not limited to: security enthusiasts, hackers wannabe, sysadmins, and developers.</p>

<p>The main purpose of this site is to have a pulic space where they will try to share their ideas, experiencies, and whatever pops up into their head.</p>

<h2>
<a id="mfprojects" class="anchor" href="#mfprojects" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>MFProjects</h2>

<p>We're actually going to share some of our projects, that may be of good public use.</p>

<h2>
<a id="mfusers" class="anchor" href="#mfusers" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>MFUsers</h2>

<p>Since we're a lot, and since github provides us with the means to do it, each member can create it's on github page inside, having their own subdomain redirected to their page.</p>

<h2>
<a id="why" class="anchor" href="#why" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why?</h2>

<p>I'm kind of tired at the moment but we've bought the domain for another year and didn't give it any good use, so now at least it has a visible, public page, which anyone inside the repository can edit.</p>

<p>So, yeah, that's basically it. </p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Matt.</p>
